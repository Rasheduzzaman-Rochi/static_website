### ‚ú® About The Project
This project is a complete front-end implementation for a corporate entity named 'iTEX GLOBAL SOURCING'. The primary goal was to create a clean, professional, and highly interactive user experience that reflects the company's brand and values.

A key highlight of this project is its dynamic product catalog. Although it's a static website without a traditional backend, it leverages vanilla JavaScript to intelligently read URL parameters. This allows it to display specific product details, filter products by partner, or show all products on a single `product.html` page, creating a fast and seamless experience akin to a single-page application (SPA).
